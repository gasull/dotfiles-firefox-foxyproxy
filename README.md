dotfiles-firefox-foxyproxy
==========================

**Do not use**.  This depends on Polipo caching server, which is unmaintained.

My ~.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/foxyproxy.xml

Do not use this for strong anonymity.  Most images and other objects will still
be loaded by the default proxy, not Tor.  This is intended as a good default for
speed (polipo) and privacy (Tor).
